# 🔐 Asymmetric Keys

---

## 1️⃣ What are Asymmetric Keys?

* **Two keys are generated together** :
* **Public Key** 🗝️ → Shared with everyone.
* **Private Key** 🔒 → Kept secret, never shared.
* They’re  **mathematically linked** :

  What one key does (encrypt/sign), the other can undo (decrypt/verify).

👉 Think of them like a  **locked mailbox** :

* Anyone can drop letters in (public key).
* Only you, with the private key, can open the box.

---

## 2️⃣ Main Uses of Asymmetric Keys

1. **Encryption (Confidentiality)**
   * Encrypt with **public key** → Decrypt with  **private key** .
   * Example: You send me a secret, you encrypt with  *my public key* . Only *my private key* can open it.
2. **Digital Signatures (Authenticity + Integrity)**
   * Sign with **private key** → Verify with  **public key** .
   * Example: I sign a document with my private key → Everyone can check using my public key that “Yes, it was really me, and message wasn’t changed.”

---

## 3️⃣ Why not only use Asymmetric Encryption?

* It’s **slow** ⚡ (math is heavy: big prime numbers, elliptic curves).
* Solution:
  * Use asymmetric encryption  **only to exchange a shared symmetric key** .
  * Then switch to **symmetric encryption** (fast, efficient).

    👉 This is what TLS, SSH, etc. do.

## 4️⃣ Algorithms for Generating Keys

| 🔑 Algorithm                   | Key Type                | Security Basis                     | Common Sizes          |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **RSA**                  | Public/Private key pair | Hard to factorize big primes       | 2048, 3072, 4096 bits |
| **DSA**                  | Digital signatures only | Discrete logarithms (mod p)        | 1024 (old), 2048 bits |
| **ECDSA**                | Signatures              | Elliptic curves (smaller, faster)  | 256, 384 bits         |
| **Ed25519**              | Signatures              | Modern elliptic curve (Curve25519) | Fixed 256 bits        |
| **Diffie–Hellman (DH)** | Key exchange            | Discrete logarithms                | 2048 bits+            |
| **ECDH**                 | Key exchange            | Elliptic curves                    | 256, 384 bits         |

## 5️⃣ Digital Signature Process (Step by Step)

Example: Server signs message "HELLO"

1. 📄 Take message → `"HELLO"`
2. 🧮 Hash it → `SHA-256("HELLO") = abc123...`
3. ✍️ Encrypt hash with **private key** = signature.
4. 📤 Send `[HELLO + signature]`

🔍 Verification:

1. Receiver hashes `"HELLO"` → gets `abc123...`
2. Decrypts signature with **public key** → also gets `abc123...`
3. ✅ If equal → message is authentic and untampered.

## 6️⃣ Strengths of Asymmetric Crypto

* ✅ No need to secretly share a key first.
* ✅ Provides **confidentiality** + **authenticity** +  **integrity** .
* ✅ Public keys can be openly distributed.

---

## 7️⃣ Weaknesses

* ❌ Slow for large data (use symmetric for bulk).
* ❌ Needs a way to trust public keys (certificates, fingerprints, PKI).
* ❌ Private key must be **very well protected** (the “crown jewels”).

---

## 8️⃣ Real-World Uses

* 🔐 **SSH** → Key pairs for user auth & server identity.
* 🌐 **TLS/SSL (HTTPS)** → Public keys in certificates, private key for server auth, exchange session key.
* 📧 **PGP/GPG** → Encrypting emails & signing them.
* 📱 **Messaging apps** (Signal, WhatsApp) → Use asymmetric to bootstrap shared keys.

---

# 🎯 TL;DR

* Two keys: **public** (share it), **private** (keep secret).
* **Encrypt with public, decrypt with private** → confidentiality.
* **Sign with private, verify with public** → authenticity.
* Asymmetric =  **slow** , so we combine with symmetric keys in practice.

## 1️⃣ Two big jobs of Asymmetric Keys

1. **Digital Signatures** ✍️
   * Private key → sign
   * Public key → verify
2. **Key Exchange / Key Transport** 🔑
   * Use asymmetric crypto to **agree on** or **protect** the symmetric key.

---

## 2️⃣ Do we *send* the symmetric key? 🤔

Depends on the method:

* **RSA key transport (older way)**
  * Client generates a random symmetric key.
  * Client encrypts that symmetric key with  **server’s public key** .
  * Sends it → Only server can decrypt (with its private key).

    ✅ Here, yes, the symmetric key is literally  *sent* , but wrapped safely.
* **Diffie–Hellman / ECDH (modern way, used in SSH/TLS)**
  * No one *sends* the shared key.
  * Both sides exchange some math values (public parameters).
  * Each side uses its **private part** + other’s **public part** to compute the same shared key.
  * An eavesdropper who only sees the exchanged values  **cannot compute the key** .

    ✅ Here, the key is  *derived* , not shared.

---

## 3️⃣ Why we don’t just use asymmetric for all encryption

* Asymmetric =  **slow + heavy** .
* Symmetric =  **fast + light** .

  👉 So:
* Asymmetric = bootstrapping (exchange/agree key + signatures).
* Symmetric = actual message encryption (bulk data).

---

### ✨ Simple analogy

* **RSA transport** = I write down the secret code (shared key), lock it in your public-key padlock, and mail it. Only you (with your private key) can unlock.
* **Diffie–Hellman** = We both follow a recipe (mixing secret spices with a public ingredient) → Both end up with the same flavor. An outsider who only sees the public ingredient can’t recreate the flavor.

---

👉 So, you’re right that we don’t just “send the symmetric key in the open.”

But sometimes we **send it encrypted with asymmetric** (RSA), and sometimes we **derive it with math** (DH/ECDH).
