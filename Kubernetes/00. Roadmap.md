🛣️ Kubernetes Learning Roadmap
1. Foundations (Core Concepts)

👉 Goal: Understand what Kubernetes is and why it’s needed.

What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes vs Docker vs Docker Swarm

Kubernetes Architecture

Master (control plane) components (API Server, etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager)

Worker node components (kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime)

Pods, Nodes, Clusters

✅ Practice:

Install Kind / Minikube

Deploy a simple Nginx pod

2. Pods & Workloads

👉 Goal: Learn how apps run inside Kubernetes.

Pods (single / multi-container)

ReplicaSets (scaling pods)

Deployments (self-healing apps)

DaemonSets (1 pod per node, e.g., monitoring agents)

StatefulSets (for databases)

Jobs & CronJobs (batch tasks)

✅ Practice:

Deploy a MERN app with frontend + backend

Scale backend using kubectl scale

3. Networking

👉 Goal: How pods talk to each other and to the outside world.

Pod-to-Pod communication (Cluster networking)

Services: ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer

DNS inside Kubernetes (CoreDNS)

Ingress (expose HTTP/HTTPS apps with rules)

CNI plugins (Flannel, Calico, Cilium)

✅ Practice:

Expose your MERN app via Service + Ingress

Curl frontend → backend inside cluster

4. Storage

👉 Goal: Make apps stateful (databases, file storage).

Volumes

Persistent Volumes (PV)

Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

Storage Classes & Dynamic provisioning

✅ Practice:

Deploy MongoDB with PVC

Connect backend pod to MongoDB via Service

5. Configuration & Secrets

👉 Goal: Externalize configs, secure secrets.

ConfigMaps (store environment configs)

Secrets (store passwords, API keys)

Mounting configs & secrets into pods

✅ Practice:

Store DB connection string in a Secret

Inject config into backend via ConfigMap

6. Advanced Workloads & Patterns

👉 Goal: Deploy production-ready apps.

Multi-container Pods (sidecars, init containers)

Affinity & Anti-affinity rules

Taints & Tolerations (control scheduling)

Namespaces (multi-tenancy)

✅ Practice:

Add a logging sidecar container

Use node affinity to run pods only on specific workers

7. Observability & Security

👉 Goal: Monitor, log, and secure clusters.

Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

Logging: EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) or Loki stack

Security:

RBAC (Role-based access control)

Network Policies

Pod Security Policies

✅ Practice:

Install Prometheus & Grafana in your cluster

Create an RBAC role that only allows viewing pods

8. Cluster Operations

👉 Goal: Learn real admin/ops tasks.

Node management (drain, cordon, taints)

Upgrades with kubeadm

Scaling cluster (add/remove nodes)

Backups (etcd)

High Availability clusters

✅ Practice:

Deploy a 3-node kubeadm cluster on EC2

Practice draining a worker node and moving pods

9. Cloud & Production

👉 Goal: Run Kubernetes at scale in cloud.

AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS

Autoscaling: HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler), VPA, Cluster Autoscaler

CI/CD with Kubernetes (GitOps with ArgoCD, Flux)

Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd)

✅ Practice:

Deploy MERN app on AWS EKS with Ingress + HPA

Add ArgoCD for GitOps deployment

10. Mastery & Beyond

👉 Goal: Become an advanced Kubernetes engineer.

Design highly available multi-region clusters

Deep dive into networking (Cilium, eBPF)

Chaos engineering with LitmusChaos

Operator pattern (write custom controllers in Go/Python)

Certification:

CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)

CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)

CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist)

🚀 Suggested Learning Path (Actionable)

Step 1 → Install Kind/Minikube → Learn Pods, Deployments, Services

Step 2 → Deploy MERN app (frontend + backend + DB)

Step 3 → Explore Ingress, Storage, Secrets, ConfigMaps

Step 4 → Learn Observability (Prometheus/Grafana)

Step 5 → Build a kubeadm cluster on EC2

Step 6 → Try Managed K8s (EKS/GKE/AKS)

Step 7 → Aim for CKA/CKAD
