# üìÑ Dockerfile Overview

A **Dockerfile** is a plain text document that contains a series of instructions used to build a Docker image. It defines everything needed to create a customized container environment.

### üîπ Purpose of a Dockerfile

- Automates the process of building Docker images.
- Ensures consistency and reproducibility across environments.
- Makes deployment easier and more reliable.

### üîπ How It Works

- The first instruction usually defines the **base image** (`FROM`).
- Additional commands are used to:
  - Install software
  - Copy files
  - Set environment variables
  - Run scripts

The final product is a Docker **image** ‚Äî a self-contained executable package with everything required to run your application.

Dockerfiles are a core part of modern DevOps workflows, enabling clean and consistent application delivery.

### üìò Dockerfile Instructions Table

| Instruction  | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FROM`       | Specifies the base image for the Docker image. Must be the first instruction.                          |
| `LABEL`      | Adds metadata to the image as key-value pairs.                                                         |
| `ENV`        | Sets environment variables inside the image.                                                           |
| `RUN`        | Executes commands in a new layer and commits the results. Often used to install packages.              |
| `CMD`        | Sets the default command to run when the container starts (can be overridden).                         |
| `ENTRYPOINT` | Configures a container to run as an executable. Cannot be overridden by command line arguments easily. |
| `COPY`       | Copies files and directories from the host into the container.                                         |
| `ADD`        | Similar to `COPY` but also supports remote URLs and unpacking compressed files.                        |
| `WORKDIR`    | Sets the working directory for `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions.             |
| `USER`       | Specifies the user to use when running the image.                                                      |
| `EXPOSE`     | Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.                   |
| `VOLUME`     | Creates a mount point and marks it as a volume to persist data.                                        |
| `ARG`        | Defines a build-time variable that users can pass at build-time.                                       |
| `ONBUILD`    | Adds a trigger instruction to be executed when the image is used as a base for another build.          |
| `SHELL`      | Overrides the default shell used for the `RUN` instructions.                                           |

### Example of a Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Add metadata to the image
LABEL maintainer="pritam@example.com"
LABEL version="1.0"
LABEL description="Example Dockerfile using all major instructions"

# Define build-time variable (can be overridden with --build-arg)
ARG APP_ENV=production

# Set environment variables
ENV NODE_ENV=$APP_ENV
ENV PORT=3000

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy application files from host to container
COPY package*.json ./

# Add a remote file (example use; not recommended for production)
ADD https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Node.gitignore .gitignore

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Create a volume to persist logs
VOLUME ["/usr/src/app/logs"]

# Expose the application port
EXPOSE $PORT

# Set default user
USER node

# Default command to run the app
CMD ["node", "index.js"]

# Alternative way to define entry point (more strict than CMD)
# ENTRYPOINT ["node", "index.js"]

# Define an on-build trigger (only relevant if this image is used as a base image)
ONBUILD COPY . /app
ONBUILD RUN npm install

# Override the default shell used for RUN commands
SHELL ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
```
