# 🐳 Docker Zero to Hero Syllabus

## **1️⃣ Basics of Docker (Foundations)**

* 📌 What is Docker? Why containers over VMs?
* 📌 Key concepts: Image, Container, Registry, Docker Hub, Layers.
* 📌 Install Docker on Linux/Windows/Mac.
* 📌 First commands:
  * `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker stop`, `docker rm`
  * `docker images`, `docker rmi`
* 📌 Pull and run images from Docker Hub.
* 📌 Difference between **Docker Engine** &  **Docker CLI** .

✅ **Interview Focus:**

* Explain the difference between VM vs Container.
* How does Docker save resources compared to VMs?

---

## **2️⃣ Docker Images & Containers**

* 📌 Creating custom images using `Dockerfile`.
* 📌 Understanding Dockerfile instructions:
  * `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, `WORKDIR`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `ENV`, `EXPOSE`.
* 📌 Layers & caching mechanism in Docker images.
* 📌 Tagging and versioning images (`docker tag`).
* 📌 Pushing & pulling from Docker Hub/private registry.

✅ **Interview Focus:**

* Difference between `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`.
* How does Docker optimize builds (layer caching)?

---

## **3️⃣ Networking in Docker**

* 📌 Types of networks:
  * **bridge** ,  **host** ,  **none** ,  **overlay** .
* 📌 Port mapping (`-p` vs `-P`).
* 📌 Container-to-container communication.
* 📌 DNS inside Docker.

✅ **Interview Focus:**

* How do containers talk to each other?
* What happens if you don’t expose a port?

---

## **4️⃣ Data Persistence & Volumes**

* 📌 Ephemeral nature of containers (data lost if container dies).
* 📌 Types of storage:
  * **Volumes** (`docker volume create`)
  * **Bind mounts**
  * **tmpfs** mounts
* 📌 Backup & restore volumes.
* 📌 Sharing volumes between multiple containers.

✅ **Interview Focus:**

* Difference between bind mounts vs volumes.
* How to persist DB data in Docker?

---

## **5️⃣ Docker Compose 🧩**

* 📌 Why Compose? (Multi-container apps)
* 📌 Structure of `docker-compose.yml`.
* 📌 Common commands:
  * `docker-compose up -d`, `docker-compose down`
* 📌 Define services, networks, and volumes.
* 📌 Scaling services with `docker-compose scale`.

✅ **Interview Focus:**

* Have you used Docker Compose in real projects?
* How does Compose simplify multi-container orchestration?

---

## **6️⃣ Docker Security 🔐**

* 📌 Running containers as non-root.
* 📌 Limiting container resources (CPU, memory).
* 📌 Docker Content Trust (DCT).
* 📌 Securing Docker Daemon.
* 📌 Image scanning for vulnerabilities.

✅ **Interview Focus:**

* Security risks of running containers as root.
* How do you secure Docker images?

---

## **7️⃣ Docker in CI/CD (Real-World Usage)**

* 📌 Dockerizing a Backend (Node.js, Python, Java).
* 📌 Dockerizing a Frontend (React, Angular).
* 📌 Using Nginx as reverse proxy inside container.
* 📌 Building and pushing images in Jenkins/GitHub Actions.
* 📌 Running tests inside Docker.

✅ **Interview Focus:**

* How do you integrate Docker in CI/CD?
* Explain the flow: Code → Build → Dockerize → Push → Deploy.

---

## **8️⃣ Advanced Docker & Internals 🛠️**

* 📌 Docker architecture (Daemon, Client, API).
* 📌 Namespaces & cgroups (Linux kernel magic).
* 📌 Docker Registry vs Private Registry.
* 📌 Multi-stage builds for optimized images.
* 📌 Docker Swarm (basic orchestration).

✅ **Interview Focus:**

* What are namespaces and cgroups?
* Why multi-stage builds?

---

## **9️⃣ Docker + Kubernetes 🌐 (for scaling)**

* 📌 Why Docker alone is not enough (need orchestration).
* 📌 Intro to Kubernetes (Pods, Services, Deployments).
* 📌 Pushing Docker images to be used in Kubernetes.

✅ **Interview Focus:**

* How does Docker fit in Kubernetes?
* What happens when you run `kubectl run` with an image?

---

## **🔟 Real-World Project (Hands-on)**

* 📌 Build a  **Full-Stack App with Docker** :
  * Backend (API in Node.js/Python).
  * Frontend (React/Angular).
  * Database (MySQL/Mongo).
  * Nginx reverse proxy.
* 📌 Run everything with Docker Compose.
* 📌 Push images to Docker Hub.
* 📌 Deploy to EC2 with Docker.

✅ **Interview Focus:**

* Walkthrough of your Docker project.
* What challenges did you face with Docker?

---

✨ **Extras for Interview Prep:**

* Most asked Docker interview questions:
  1. Difference between `COPY` and `ADD`.
  2. Difference between `CMD` vs `ENTRYPOINT`.
  3. How do you reduce Docker image size?
  4. How do you monitor containers?
  5. How do you troubleshoot a failing container?
