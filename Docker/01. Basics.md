## Why Docker? 🤔

Before Docker, applications were difficult to **set up, scale, and deploy consistently** across environments.

### 🛑 Problems Docker Solves:

- **"It works on my machine!"** – Docker eliminates this by packaging dependencies and configuration together.
- Difficult and bulky **VM-based deployments**.
- Slow and resource-intensive CI/CD pipelines.
- Painful environment setup for developers.

### ✅ With Docker:

- **Consistent** environments from development to production.
- **Lightweight & fast** deployments.
- Easier to build, test, and ship applications.

## What is Docker? 🐳

**Docker** is an open-source platform that enables developers to **automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers**.

A **container** is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably in any environment.

> Think of Docker as a shipping container for software!

## Containers vs Virtual Machines 🆚

| Feature        | Virtual Machines (VMs)     | Containers                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Boot Time      | Minutes                    | Seconds                          |
| Size           | GBs (includes OS)          | MBs (shares host OS)             |
| Performance    | Slower (emulates hardware) | Faster (uses host kernel)        |
| Isolation      | Strong (separate OS)       | Process-level isolation          |
| Portability    | Lower (OS-specific)        | High (runs anywhere Docker runs) |
| Resource Usage | High                       | Low                              |

## Docker Architecture 🧱

Docker uses a **client-server architecture**.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Docker CLI] --> B[Docker Daemon]
    B --> C[Images]
    B --> D[Containers]
    B --> E[Docker Hub]
```

### 🧩 Components:

1. **Docker Client**Interacts with the Docker daemon via CLI or API.
2. **Docker Daemon (dockerd)**Responsible for building, running, and managing containers.
3. **Docker Images**Read-only templates used to create containers.
4. **Docker Containers**Runnable instances of Docker images.
5. **Docker Registries**
   Stores Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).
