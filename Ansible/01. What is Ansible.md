# 📘 **Section 1: Basics & Fundamentals**

### 🔹 What is Ansible?

* **Definition** : Ansible is an **open-source IT automation tool** used for configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.
* **Developed by** : Michael DeHaan, later acquired by RedHat.
* **Key Point** : It is  **agentless** , meaning no software needs to be installed on managed nodes.
* Works over **SSH** (Linux/Unix) and **WinRM** (Windows).

---

## 📜 Brief History of Ansible

* 🧑‍💻 **Created by Michael DeHaan** in  **2012** .
* 🐧 Initially built as a simple, agentless automation tool for Linux systems.
* 🌟 Gained popularity due to its simplicity compared to Puppet & Chef.
* 🏢 In  **2015** , **Red Hat acquired Ansible** → integrated into Red Hat Automation Suite.
* 🛠️ Today, it’s one of the most widely used automation tools for  **cloud, devops, networking, and security** .

---

🔹 Why use Ansible?

* **Simplicity** : Uses **YAML** (human-readable syntax).
* **Agentless** : No agents running on client machines.
* **Idempotency** : Ensures that applying a playbook multiple times results in the same state.
* **Cross-Platform** : Supports Linux, Unix, macOS, Windows, cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP).
* **Scalability** : Can manage 1 to 1000+ servers with the same playbook.

---

### 🔹 Push vs Pull Configuration Management

* **Push (Ansible approach)** :
* Control node pushes configuration to target nodes over SSH.
* Example: `ansible-playbook site.yml` runs from control node → updates all managed nodes.
* **Pull (e.g., Puppet, Chef)** :
* Client nodes periodically pull configs from a central server.

👉 In interviews, highlight that  **Ansible = push-based + agentless** .

### 🔹 Ansible Architecture

**Main Components:**

1. **Control Node**
   * The system where Ansible is installed.
   * Executes playbooks and manages inventory.
2. **Managed Nodes**
   * Target machines (servers, network devices, cloud instances).
   * Require only SSH or WinRM access.
3. **Inventory**
   * A list of managed nodes (static or dynamic).
   * Example:
```ini
[web]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11
```
4. **Modules**
   * Predefined units of work (like `yum`, `apt`, `service`, `copy`, `file`).
   * Example: `ansible all -m ping` uses the `ping` module.
5. **Playbooks**
   * YAML files defining automation tasks.
   * Example:
```yaml
- hosts: web
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present
```

---

### 🔹 SSH & Agentless Nature

* Ansible does not require installing software on nodes.
* Uses **SSH keys** or passwords to connect.
* Supports privilege escalation (`become: yes` for sudo).

---

### 🔹 YAML Basics (Essential for Playbooks)

* **YAML = “Yet Another Markup Language”**
* Used because it’s  **human-readable** .
* Rules:
  1. Indentation is  **spaces only** , no tabs.
  2. Use `-` for lists.
  3. Key-value pairs separated by `:`.

Example:

```yaml
name: Pritam
skills:
  - DevOps
  - Ansible
  - Terraform
```

✅ **Interview Checkpoints (Section 1):**

* Explain **Ansible architecture** clearly.
* Difference between  **push vs pull tools** .
* Why Ansible is  **agentless** .
* Show a **basic inventory + ad-hoc command** example.

# 📘 **Section 2: Installation & Setup**

### 🔹 Installation of Ansible

**On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y
ansible --version
```

**On RHEL/CentOS:**

```bash
sudo yum install epel-release -y
sudo yum install ansible -y
```

**On macOS (via Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install ansible
```

**On Windows:**

* Install **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** and run Ansible inside Linux environment.
* OR use a **control node VM** on Linux.

---

### 🔹 Ansible Configuration File

Default file: `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

You can also have:

* **Global config** → `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`
* **User config** → `~/.ansible.cfg`
* **Project config** → `./ansible.cfg` (highest priority)

**Important sections inside `ansible.cfg`:**

```ini
[defaults]
inventory = ./hosts
remote_user = ubuntu
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/id_rsa
host_key_checking = False
```

---

### 🔹 Inventory File

Defines managed nodes.

**Static Inventory Example:**

```ini
[web]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11

[db]
192.168.1.20 ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Dynamic Inventory Example:**

* Uses scripts/plugins to fetch hosts dynamically (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure).

```bash
ansible-inventory -i inventory_aws_ec2.yml --list
```

---

### 🔹 Ad-Hoc Commands

Quick commands without playbooks.

Examples:

```bash
# Ping all servers
ansible all -m ping

# Check uptime of all servers
ansible all -m command -a "uptime"

# Install package on web servers
ansible web -m yum -a "name=nginx state=present"
```

✅ **Interview Checkpoints (Section 2):**

* Installation steps (Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows).
* Explain `ansible.cfg` priority.
* Static vs Dynamic inventory.
* Difference between  **ad-hoc command vs playbook** .
